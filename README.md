# Welcome to Canadian Permanent Residency Application Helper

Hi. My name is Paul Kang, also an ex-PR applicants for Canadian Permanent Resident in 2020. I have created this web application to personalize your experience with the PR application journey, as well as predict the CRS scores for the next few draws with the help of AI and statistical forecastings.

Once you signup/login with this application, you will be prompted to fill in the application questionaires and you will be able to view your saved queries in the future without doing replicative steps on the PR CRS calculator tool.

Also, once you have completed the questionaires you will be prompted to your own dashboard where it provides the score summary, past CRS score and invitation records, AI-enabled CRS predictions and expected timeline for your entire PR application.

There is also a tab for simulator which allows you to try out different scenarios of your unique circumstances (just like "what if I get higher score in IELTS english test") and see how your score will change. This really allows you to see what would be your target crs score for you to receive an Invitation-To-Apply from IRCC.

Hope this application helps with your overall PR journey.
